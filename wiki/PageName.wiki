#summary Code Style Guide

Strongly (but not completely) based on the Google C++ Stype Guide.

Everything must be in english.

= Define Guards =
All headers MUST have a #define guard with this format:
{{{
#ifndef ARMAGIC_<FILE>_H_
#define ARMAGIC_<FILE>_H_
...
#endif
}}}

= Classes =
Should start with a capital letter and have no underscores.
public, protected and private keywords should not be indented and should appear in this order.
Ex:
{{{
class MyNewClass {
public:
   
   int myMethod();
protected:
   int myProtected;
private:
   int myInt_;
}
}}}

= Functions/Methods and Common Variables =
Should start with lowercase letter and have no underscores.
Ex:
{{{
myNewMethod();
int myIntVariable = 0;
}}}

= Class Data Members =
Should always have a trailing underscore
Ex:
{{{
int myDataMember_;
}}}

= Namespaces =
All lower case, and it's contents are not indented.

= Braces =
Braces should open beside the code and should have a space before.



For instance, that's all folks.
